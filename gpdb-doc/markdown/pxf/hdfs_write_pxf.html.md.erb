The PXF HDFS connector supports writable external tables using the `HdfsTextSimple` and `SequenceWritable` profiles. You might create a writable table to export data from a Greenplum Database internal table to binary or text HDFS files.

Use the `HdfsTextSimple` profile when writing text data. Use the `SequenceWritable` profile when dealing with binary data.

This section describes how to use these PXF profiles to write data to HDFS.

Note: Tables that you create with writable profiles can only be used for `INSERT` operations. If you want to query inserted data, you must create a separate external readable table that references the new HDFS file, specifying the equivalent readable profile.

## <a id="hdfswrite_prereq"></a>Prerequisites

Before working with HDFS file data using PXF, ensure that:

-  You have installed and configured a Hadoop client on each Greenplum Database segment host. Refer to [Installing and Configuring the Hadoop Client for PXF](hdfsclient_instcfg.html) for instructions.
- You have initialized and started PXF on your Greenplum Database segment hosts. See [Configuring, Initializing, and Starting PXF](cfginitstart_pxf.html) for PXF initialization, configuration, and startup information.
- You have granted the `gpadmin` user read and write permission to the appropriate directories in your HDFS file system.
